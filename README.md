# MyGame
My game on the Godot Engine. Written in GDScript, and may implement C++ code at some point. It needs a lot of work, but I have hope.

# Install
Download the Zip and extract in a new directory. (Windows will stop you from running it in certain locations, so make a new folder wherever you would like)

# Play
Run the application file, use arrow keys to play. Have fun!
